### THEORY

Increasingly common, early childhood care plays an important role in children’s development and provides a valuable support to families with young children. It is therefore important to understand the impact of these services and to ensure their quality and accessibility.

### What Is Baby Care needed?

In order to examine the impact of child care on the development of very young children it is necessary to define child care and quality of care. Child care may simply be defined as non-parental care in a child’s own house. Baby Care app provides support services for working parents to reduce their stress.

3)	Medical details
4)	Health care tips

#### 1.	Registration and Login Module:
In this module the parent has to register their name and the child name first, and then they will create their own profile with com.arnab.datta.babycare.user name and password.

In this module details such as date of birth, place of birth, age, height, weight and etc. are to be filled in.



#### 3.	Medical Details Module:
In this module details such as blood group, all the vaccine details, baby’s doctor details can be saved for getting quick information during rush. We are also planning to add alarm system to create reminder at the time of taking vaccines.


#### 4.	Health Care Tips Module:
In this module, the parents can easily look for medicines and other tips regarding common health issues of their little one.

### ANALYSIS & DISCUSSIONS

In the United States, between 1980 and 1998, the labour force participation rate of mothers with infants rose from 38% to 59%. In 1999, 44% of infants under 1 year of age, 53% of 1-year-olds, and 57% of 2-year-olds were in non-parental care on a regular basis. Research on early social, emotional and cognitive development suggests that the short and long term consequences of care giving contexts are less dependent on the form of care than on the equality of care.
Research studies on links between child care and development for young children are, of necessity, correlational rather than experimental. Early and extensive care in poor quality facilities does emerge as disadvantageous. Infants and toddler experience less positive mother-child interaction.
Our app will help parents to come closer to their child and take their utmost care. Parents will enjoy the journey with their toddlers.


### 	CONCLUSION

The main objective of the project is to create a secured and happy caring relation between parents and their toddler. We had taken a wide range of literature review in order to achieve all the tasks, where we came to know about some of the products that are existing in the market. We made a detailed research in that path to cover the loop holes that existing systems are facing and to eradicate them in our application. In the process of research we came to know about the different problems faced by parents, especially working ones.
As a result, the product has been successfully developed in terms of extendibility, portability, and maintainability and tested in order to meet all requirements that are
•	Authentication
•	Alarm system
•	Health care
which are specified as the three basic concepts for the proper baby care.

### FUTURE SCOPE

With the knowledge we have gained by developing this, we are confident that in the future we can make the application more effectively by adding this services.
•	Extending this application by providing Doctor Service.
•	Increasing the health care tips and also prevention tips.
•	Extending it to Web Support.


### LIMITATIONS
Some drawbacks of the Baby Care application are as follows:
•	The app is only for 0-3 years old kids.
•	Absence of proper database connection.
•	Can be improved further by adding more alarm systems
