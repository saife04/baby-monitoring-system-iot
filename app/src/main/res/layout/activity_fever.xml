	It's important that baby keeps taking breast milk or formula during a fever to avoid dehydration.

Do not stop breast milk -
	If your baby is breast-feeding, try to nurse more often to prevent dehydration.

Give him a fever reducer as the doctor prescribes -
	Your doctor might recommend giving your child some baby acetaminophen (or ibuprofen, if your baby is at least 6 months old) to bring down the fever. Never give more than the recommended dosage to your child; her weight will determine the right dose. And always use the measuring device that comes with the medicine to give your baby exactly the right amount.

Try a lukewarm bath -
	If baby is running a high fever and seems uncomfortable, put him in a lukewarm bath to try to bring his body temperature down. You can also wet some washcloths and give him a sponge bath if you don't think he's going to react well to being in the tub.

Change wet diapers.
